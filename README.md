## Inspiration

> We were majorly inspired by Nintendo's StreetPass to create a social app for your phone.

## What it does

> This is a social app that allows you to meet people as you pass by them on the street. The app prompts you to create a profile that asks you what you have been up to during the week and gives you the opportunity to ask people a question. Others that happen to pass by you can answer to the said question and you can see their responses. You, respectively, can answer others questions as well.


## How we built it

> We built the app for Android in Android Studio utilizing Flutter. We also implemented the Google Nearby Connections API to get the pass by function to work.

## Challenges we ran into

> The main challenge was definitely understanding and getting Flutter to
> work in our favor. A lot of the challenge came from us all trying to
> understand Flutter for the first time ever.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

> We are very proud of getting the Google Nearby API to work with the
> program as it was very essential to our project.

## What we learned

> We learned how to make a social app for the first time in Flutter with
> the use of Google Nearby API.

## What's next for PassMe

> If we were to expand PassMe, we could probably implement friending and
> small minigames to incentivize people meeting each other when using
> the app. Moderation features would also be a must have to further
> expand the app.
